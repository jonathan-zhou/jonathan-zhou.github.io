    <h1 class="LargerSize">• What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
        core learning?</h1>
    <p>
       I have learned that it is still possible for me to learn new things despite not liking school and Uni very much,
       although it is a slow process when trying to absorb information. I have also learned that asking for help isn't
       a weakness either, it's something I need to do a lot more of. I don't think my ego has increased since I try to 
       be mindful about it. 
    </p>    

    <h1 class="LargerSize">• What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h1>
    <p>
       Values and self awareness during learning help to create a better focus when it comes to learning, by
       instilling a good ethic it creates a better drive towards learning while self awareness helps to understand
       the strengths and weaknesses of one's skills even in programming. Having Empathy for others helps to understand
       that learning is not just a one person endeavour. By helping others it can create friendships/relationships and 
       share knowledge/information. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="LargerSize">• What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
       Learning that the brain is malleable and can improve through repetition and practice is very surprising to me.
       The benefits of Neuroplasticity and how it benefits people such as recovering from illness or can help students
       by simply knowing about it surprises me as well. 
    </p>

    <h1 class="LargerSize">• What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
    <p>
        I think having to write up answers for some of the Core questions were pretty difficult haha. The research
        about one's values and self reflection back in Sprint 1 was also pretty challenging in my opinion. 
        Everything else was decently manageable.
    </p>

    <h1 class="LargerSize">• Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core 
        learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
    
    <p>
        To help people become more open-minded, creative and sympathetic in both their lives and in their careers.
        People recognizing each other's emotions help to create more adaptable and productive work places as 
        research has shown. 
    </p>    

    <h1 class="LargerSize">• Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
         have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h1>
    
    <p>
        No I don't feel like it was a waste of time. I think if I hadn't learned about Core, I wouldn't have learned
        as much about both myself and programming.
