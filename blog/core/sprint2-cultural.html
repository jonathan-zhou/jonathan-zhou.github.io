        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>My goal is to become a web developer whilst earning a stable income to possibly support myself and my family.</p>
        
        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h1>
        <p>A strength of mine is being able to take a bunch of text and being able to put it into simpler terms for me to understand. Being able to stay calm even under pressure is also a strength I have however, my limitation is that it’s difficult to get started alongside my poor time management skills. The text I use might be simple for me to understand but not so simple for others.</p>
    
        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?"</h1>
        <p>My time management skills, ability to stick to a schedule, my social skills and networking skills too</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A commitment to how you will manage yourself in this programme.</h1>
        <p>I will do my best to minimize any distractions which include my phone, keeping away from the house if possible, create a schedule and set aside time to work. With others I will respect and treat my peers and facilitators with kindness, as well as listening properly as not to become an issue or burden. If things do start building up then I will possibly ask for help from my peers if possible but if I know I am hindering myself then I will dedicate time to work on and correct it.</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
        <p>If I cannot find the answer I am looking for on google then i’ll ask for help asking people face to face, on slack in a dm or foundations channel or ask a facilitator but only as a last resort.</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h1>
        <p>I expect the team to possibly guide and offer advice on whatever I may be having difficulty with as well as providing material that is relevant to the topic at hand.</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
        <p>Picking my sister from school and dropping her off to whatever out of school activity she is learning and any potential errands my parents will ask me to run. </p>
