        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>My goal is to become a web developer whilst earning a stable income to possibly support myself and my family.</p>
        
        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h1>
        <p>A strength of mine is being able to take a bunch of text and being able to put it into simpler terms for me to understand. Being able to stay calm even under pressure is also a strength I have however, my limitation is that it’s difficult to get started alongside my poor time management skills. The text I use might be simple for me to understand but not so simple for others.</p>
    
        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?"</h1>
        <p>My time management skills, ability to stick to a schedule, my social skills and networking skills too</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A commitment to how you will manage yourself in this programme.</h1>
        <p>I will do my best to minimize any distractions which include my phone, keeping away from the house if possible, create a schedule and set aside time to work. With others I will respect and treat my peers and facilitators with kindness, as well as listening properly as not to become an issue or burden. If things do start building up then I will possibly ask for help from my peers if possible but if I know I am hindering myself then I will dedicate time to work on and correct it.</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h1>
        <p>If I cannot find the answer I am looking for on google then i’ll ask for help asking people face to face, on slack in a dm or foundations channel or ask a facilitator but only as a last resort.</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h1>
        <p>I expect the team to possibly guide and offer advice on whatever I may be having difficulty with as well as providing material that is relevant to the topic at hand.</p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h1>
        <p>Picking my sister from school and dropping her off to whatever out of school activity she is learning and any potential errands my parents will ask me to run. </p>


        <h1 class="LargerSize">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h1>
        <p>
            My long term goal remains the same. To become a developer and make enough to support my family. If the opportunity does come, I would like to make some sort of impact with a project.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
        <p>
            My biggest strength might be my human skills and maybe my ability to turn difficult text into my own words although that has become increasingly difficult with each week. 
            My limitations might be me locking up if I come across something difficult and asking for help/tips from people.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h1>
        <p>
            Asking for help from others, managing my time properly and being honest with myself about how I am doing.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h1>
        <p>
            My time management, social skills, networking skills and honesty. Just improving myself in any way possible.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h1>
        <p>
            I expect the Bootcamp team to provide me material that relates to the topic at hand as well as a guiding hand on whatever I may be stuck at.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h1>
        <p>
            To commit myself as much as I can to learning, become a better programmer, be less reliant but still communicative with others, stick to a 
            schedule as much as I can and be more open and honest about myself. I can do all this by following my learning plan, committing to practice 
            and learning to become independent when it comes to problem solving. In general I want to do my best to push myself.
            I will work safely with others including facilitators and other students by communicating in a calm manner about any issues that may arise.
