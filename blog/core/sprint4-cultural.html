        <h1 class='LargerSize'>1. Research Neuroplasticity</h1>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>• Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h1>
        <p>
           Just from knowing about the concept of Neuroplasticity and how our brain works is enough to change people’s outlook on 
           the brain and intelligence. It has helped students do better in school and help people recover from mental/physical ailments.
        </p>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>• Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h1>
        <p>
            Knowing that my brain is malleable and can improve through practice can be quite beneficial.
        </p>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>• What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>
            Practice whenever possible, put information into my own words if possible and reminding myself that the brain is malleable and not predetermined.

        <h1 class="LargerSize">2. Research Growth Mindset</h1>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h1>
        <p>
           A growth mindset is having an understanding that it is possible to overcome obstacles when learning a new skill by having persistence and determination.
           It is relevant to learning as it is more beneficial to learning compared to a fixed mindset where fixed mindsets can influence our development of skills 
           and learning in a bad way.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h1>
        <p>
            The fact that it is possible to improve/learn better simply by shifting your mindset is quite amazing to me. 
            It has changed my outlook on learning and wish to implement it more in my everyday life.
        </p>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h1>
        <p>
           I can integrate growth mindset by reminding myself each day that I am here to learn along with others doing the same task. 
           I will also ask others for help if I’m stuck in something too.

        <h1 class="LargerSize">3. Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h1>

        <h1 class="LargerSize">• Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h1>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity works by having brain neural networks connect and fire together, by practicing tasks/material often  and rewriting information into words I 
           can understand they can become more thick and hardy thus allowing information to be remembered. Growth Mindset is having a mentality dedicated to learning. 
           Being resilient in the face of obstacles with determination. Using words like “not yet” rather than “I can’t” is a method to keep a Growth Mindset.
           I’ve implemented these 2 concepts at the start of Bootcamp and have helped very much at keeping me going even when things became difficult.
