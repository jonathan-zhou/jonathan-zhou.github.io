        My name is Jonathan Zhou, I was born and raised here in Auckland for a majority of my life. I had previously worked in Hospitality and like to think I have a decent grasp of people’s skills although I have decided to move away from doing Hospitality and look into a career in IT/Tech as both a change of pace and to find out if this is what I would really like to do as a career.

I don’t think I have many cultural values instilled in me that have influenced who I am as a person but my parents did teach me to be both respectful and kind to people you meet which has gotten me far and oftentimes given me great joy. One of my resolutions this year was to improve myself as both a person and how I did things especially when it came to studying, by removing or changing things I didn’t like about myself little by little if possible. The last thing I value the most in both myself but also in other people is being able to be yourself, trying to imitate others mostly leads to misfortune as I have come to find. Stay true to what you love and who you are as a person.

Back when I used to work in Hospitality we had a manager who would be quite arrogant and harsh to her co-workers (me included). Most of the staff had enough of her attitude towards us and wanted to tell the main manager about her treatment but most were worried that the complaints would go nowhere as both managers were very good friends and it might be brushed aside. I decided I had enough and spoke to the main manager about the issues. The main manager thankfully was very grateful that I told him and went to resolve the issue. The manager from there on treated everyone but me with much more respect. I didn’t mind taking the brunt of it as working with my co-workers far outweighed any words she spoke. A few months later the manager decided to resign. 

My strengths are in my ability to take large chunks of text and compressing them into smaller texts and words that I can understand. If needed or if I feel comfortable I can put myself in a leadership position. I would also say my ability to stay calm under pressure is both a boon and a bane. My weaknesses would be in my lacking ability to manage my time/schedule as well as finding the motivation to get started on something especially study. I do find that if I have a goal or a structure to work towards it is easier to get that motivation.
