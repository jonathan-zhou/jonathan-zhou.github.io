    <h1>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</h1>
    <p>What are classes and IDs? They are CSS elements that can apply and manipulate HTML elements, similar to an image manipulatator like Photoshop how you can adjust image length, size, position, etc.</p>
    <p>The difference between the two is that Classes can be applied to multiple HTML elements which can make things simplier if you need something to show up on every page such as a sidebar while IDs should only be used once in a single HTML element, in other words it should be unique to once HTML element. </p1>

    <p>Both selectors also have their own symbol to identify whether they are a Class or ID. Classes use the "." (fullstop) symbol whilst IDs use a # (hash) symbol.</p>
    <p>some class examples would be below: using a Class to make some text red and using an ID to make a specific piece of text yellow and appear only on the right side</p>
      </div>
    
    <p class="Red-Text">This text is red</p>
    <p class="Red-Text">This text is also red</p>
    <p id="Example-Yellow">This text is unique because it is the only one using yellow and on the right side</p>

    <p>Example of both a class selector and ID selector below in CSS.</p>
