       I was stuck on finalizing my Super Fizzbuzz function, for the longest time I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working,
       I was pretty sure most of the code was correct. I tried different variables and arguments but none would work, reading 
       error message wasn't too much and neither was googling the problem. I decided maybe it was time to grab something to 
       eat so I decided to take a break. When I came back from my break, I could finally see what was wrong with it. Turns out
       I was missing an else if on my 3rd if statement (before the else) and I needed to place my return another bracket lower 
       otherwise it would consider it as part of the if/else statements. I learned to properly read over my code and check for 
       any incorrect syntax too. Breaks are important too.

        Psuedocode: With Psuedocode I feel I might need to write less vague and maybe even illogical psuedocode. Maybe practicing to write
        actual code better first then writing the code in plain english might help.

        Trying something: I don't feel too particularly comfortable with trying out alot of different variables with my current level of knowledge.

        Googling: Googling was quite helpful at points such as learning how to do an average.

        Asking peers: Asking tips from peers and friends was difficult at first but after getting down the idea that it's okay to ask for help if it 
        contributes to my learning, it became much easier. (no straight answers for any of the Katas were given).

        Improving your process with reflection: Putting down what i've learnt through reflection is very helpful. I still feel I don't do enough of it 
        however (haha).
