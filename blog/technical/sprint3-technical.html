        <h1 class='LargerSize'>• An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>HTML is like the builder, HTML builds and constructs the main contents of the document/webpage using different elements and objects. CSS is the artist, they organize and stylize everything such as how something should look, use what font, where text or an image should be placed, etc.</p>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>• Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h1>
        <p>Control Flow is similar to decision making in real life. For a computer, Control Flow is the order of a piece of code/script and how it will execute that code/script but can be modified using if and else statements. Loops let you repeat a piece of code/script over and over until you reach a conclusion/fulfill all conditions/something is no longer true. For example, say you're grocery shopping and at the end of your shopping you decide whether to buy the chocolate bar at the counter or not. You might think about the decision over and over weighing the pros and cons (loops). IF you decide to not buy the chocolate bar you can simply finish your shopping right there and save a little bit of money, ELSE you decide to buy the chocolate bar. (Control Flow using if and else).</p>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>• Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h1>
        <p>The DOM aka the Document Object Model is a programming API (Application Programming Interface). Each word in the DOM can be explained as such: 
        <h1 class='LargerSize'> Document:</h1>
        <p>The Document mainly refers to the website or the HTML Document itself.</p>
        <h1 class='LargerSize'> Objects:</h1>
        <p>To the DOM, everything in an HTML document is considered an object which means everything is flexible. Because everything is considered an object (flexible), this is why the DOM can add, delete or change content on an HTML document.</p>
        <h1 class='LargerSize'> Model:</h1>
        <p>The Model is basically how everything on the HTML page is laid out like a tree diagram.</p>
        <p>The example below changes the previous header text "Technical Blog - JS Fundamentals" to "Let's change this".</p>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
        <p>Arrays and Objects function similarly as both of them store pieces of data. Arrays are used when multiple pieces of data need to be stored in a single variable. Best used when you want to access/view data in it's numerical position (using zero-based indexing). Objects are used when you need it to represent something significant or a thing in the code, like a book, a car, an animal, etc. Useful for when you need to have data stored in a structed way. To access data in an Array you would use [] brackets and it's numerical position to access it. For an Object you can use either a . (dot) or [] brackets notation to access it's data.</p>

        <h1 class='LargerSize'>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h1>
        <p>Functions are procedures that take an input, perform a specific task and return/output a result/value/task. It is particularly useful for when you require a piece of code to be repeated instead of writing each code with little alterations over and over.</p>
